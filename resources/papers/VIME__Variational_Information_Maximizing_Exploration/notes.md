## Notes

### Selected Direct Quotes, Data, and Formulas

1. **Objective and Motivation**  
   > “This paper introduces Variational Information Maximizing Exploration (VIME), an exploration strategy based on maximization of information gain about the agent’s belief of environment dynamics. [...] VIME modifies the MDP reward function, and can be applied with several different underlying RL algorithms. We demonstrate that VIME achieves significantly better performance compared to heuristic exploration methods across a variety of continuous control tasks and algorithms, including tasks with very sparse rewards.”

   The authors address a fundamental issue in RL: how to explore in high-dimensional or continuous domains, where tabular methods or naive random exploration are ineffective.

2. **Information Gain / Curiosity**  
   The core approach sets out to maximize the **information gain** about the agent’s internal *Bayesian* model of the environment dynamics \(\Theta\). At time step \(t\), the agent’s next state is \(S_{t+1}\), and the agent’s belief over the dynamics model is updated from \(p(\theta \mid \xi_t)\) to \(p(\theta \mid \xi_t, A_t, S_{t+1})\). The **mutual information** the agent obtains is

   \[
   I(S_{t+1}; \Theta \,\bigm|\; \xi_t, A_t)
   \;=\;
   \mathbb{E}_{S_{t+1}} \bigl[
     D_{\mathrm{KL}}
       \bigl[p(\theta \mid \xi_t, A_t, S_{t+1})
             \,\big\|\,p(\theta \mid \xi_t)\bigr]
   \bigr].
   \]

   This quantity measures “how much the agent’s new observation reduces uncertainty about \(\Theta\).”

3. **Variational Bayes Approximation**  
   An exact update of \(p(\theta \mid \xi_t, A_t, S_{t+1})\) is typically intractable for complex neural net dynamics models. Instead, the authors use **variational inference** to maintain a distribution \(q(\theta;\phi)\) over the parameters \(\theta\), updating \(\phi\) to approximate the posterior. The agent’s **intrinsic reward** then approximates
   \[
   D_{\mathrm{KL}}\bigl[q(\theta;\,\phi_{t+1}) \,\big\|\,
                      q(\theta;\,\phi_{t})\bigr],
   \]
   the change in the model’s parameter distribution after observing the new transition.

4. **Full MDP Reward**  
   Let \(r(s_t,a_t)\) be the extrinsic reward. VIME modifies it to
   \[
   r'(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1})
   \;=\;
   r(s_t,a_t)
   \;+\;
   \eta \; D_{\mathrm{KL}}\!\Bigl[q(\theta;\,\phi_{t+1})\,\Big\|\,q(\theta;\,\phi_t)\Bigr],
   \]
   where \(\eta\) is a hyperparameter balancing exploration vs. exploitation. The second term acts as a curiosity bonus.

5. **Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs)**  
   The agent’s dynamics model is a **BNN** that predicts \(S_{t+1}\) from \((S_t, A_t)\). Its weight distribution is represented by a fully factorized Gaussian \(q(\theta;\phi)\). Minimizing
   \[
   \text{KL}[\,q(\theta;\phi)\,\|\,p(\theta)\,]
   - \mathbb{E}_{\theta \sim q}[\log p(\text{data}\mid \theta)]
   \]
   yields a variational approximation to the true posterior. The BNN is updated on transitions stored in a replay buffer.  
   - The **KL divergence** for the intrinsic reward is approximated by a single step of second-order optimization (or a Hessian-based approach), avoiding expensive repeated inference.

6. **Interpretation as Compression**  
   The authors show a link to “compression improvement” or “learning progress.” They note:
   > “Optimizing for compression improvement is effectively optimizing the reversed KL divergence from \(\theta\mid \xi_{t-1}\) to \(\theta\mid \xi_t, A_t, S_{t+1}\). In practice, both forms coincide when the changes in \(\phi\) are small.”

7. **Algorithmic Summary**  
   The method (Algorithm 1) interleaves:
   1. Gathering samples with a policy \(\pi_\alpha\).  
   2. For each sample, computing the approximate KL \(\mathrm{KL}[\,q(\theta;\phi_{t+1})\,\|\,q(\theta;\phi_t)\,]\).  
   3. Rescaling it and adding to the extrinsic reward.  
   4. Updating \(\pi_\alpha\) via any standard RL algorithm (e.g., TRPO or REINFORCE).  
   5. Updating the BNN’s variational parameters \(\phi\) at intervals using replay data.

8. **Experiments**

   - **Sparse Rewards**: Tasks such as *MountainCar*, *CartPoleSwingup*, *HalfCheetah* with a very sparse or delayed extrinsic reward.  
     - **Baseline**: naive Gaussian noise or \(\ell_2\) prediction-error-based curiosity fails to discover the goal.  
     - **VIME**: effectively explores, leading to successful strategies.  

   - **Shaped Rewards**: On tasks like *Walker2D*, *DoublePendulum*, and *SwimmerGather*, adding VIME significantly improves performance for algorithms prone to local minima.  
   - **Robust to Large State Spaces**: Because the agent’s BNN handles continuous states and actions, VIME scales better than tabular methods.  

   **Key Result**:  
   > “VIME achieves significantly better performance compared to heuristic exploration methods across a variety of continuous control tasks [...] obtains coherent motion primitives in tasks like SwimmerGather even without immediate external reward.”

9. **Influence of Hyperparameter \(\eta\)**  
   \(\eta\) controls how strongly to weight curiosity vs. extrinsic reward. A wide range of \(\eta\) values yields good performance. If \(\eta\) is too large, the agent over-explores and ignores extrinsic reward; if too small, it reverts to near-heuristic exploration.

10. **Conclusions**  
    - **Novelty**: A Bayesian approach to dynamics modeling combined with a curiosity bonus from **information gain**.  
    - **Scalability**: Works in high-dimensional continuous tasks with neural network function approximators.  
    - **Future Work**: Investigate measuring surprise in the *value function* instead of environment dynamics, or using the learned dynamics model for planning.

### Concise Summary of the Article

**“VIME: Variational Information Maximizing Exploration”** presents a framework for curiosity-driven RL in continuous or high-dimensional environments. The **agent** maintains a **Bayesian neural network** to represent environment dynamics. After each transition, the agent updates its approximate posterior over BNN weights. The agent receives **intrinsic reward** equal to the KL divergence between old and new weight distributions—capturing the *information gain* or “surprise” about the environment. This *variational Bayes* approach yields a tractable approximation of the exploration bonus for neural network models.

Extensive experiments on continuous-control benchmarks show that VIME far outperforms naive Gaussian or \(\epsilon\)-greedy exploration, especially when rewards are sparse. By systematically seeking out transitions that most reduce uncertainty in the dynamics model, the agent learns essential control strategies (e.g., locomotion primitives) even in the absence of immediate extrinsic feedback.

**Key Outcomes**:
- VIME significantly boosts performance on tasks like *MountainCar*, *HalfCheetah*, *Walker2D*, and the more complex *SwimmerGather*.  
- The approach is agnostic to the underlying RL algorithm; tested with TRPO, REINFORCE, and ERWR.  
- The agent’s BNN parameters \(\phi\) are updated via a replay buffer, approximating the posterior distribution with a diagonal Gaussian.  
- A single-step second-order approximation efficiently yields the intrinsic reward (KL divergence) for each transition.

Overall, **VIME** successfully demonstrates that curiosity based on *information gain about the environment dynamics* scales to non-trivial continuous RL tasks.

### Relevance to "Adaptive Curiosity for Exploration in Partially Random Reinforcement Learning Environments"

- **Partial Randomness**: By focusing on how each new transition updates the agent’s *Bayesian neural net*, VIME **discounts** purely random or uncontrollable transitions (once recognized as noise, they no longer reduce posterior uncertainty). This is exactly the principle that helps avoid “noisy TV” traps.
- **Adaptive Curiosity**: VIME adaptively guides exploration to states that yield maximal *epistemic* uncertainty reduction in the dynamics, a core objective in many curiosity-driven frameworks.

Hence, **it is highly relevant** for research on “adaptive curiosity” in partially random domains, as VIME explicitly addresses how to measure “surprise” or “learning progress” in large state-action spaces.

### How It May Inform Future Research

1. **Extended Bayesian Approximations**: Exploring more sophisticated ensemble or variational distributions for the environment model (e.g., normalizing flows, functional priors) might further improve exploration in partially random or harder tasks.
2. **Value-Function Surprise**: The paper mentions investigating curiosity regarding the value function. Combining or comparing *dynamics-based* and *value-based* surprises could yield deeper synergy.
3. **Hybrid Intrinsic Rewards**: Merging VIME’s info gain with other signals (e.g., random network distillation, disagreement, or count-based exploration) might better handle complex or multi-stage partial randomness.
4. **Real-World Robotics**: Adapting VIME’s BNN-based approach to real robots where partial observability and non-stationary noise are typical. The method’s ability to discount “unlearnable” transitions might reduce wasted exploration.
5. **Multi-Step Planning**: With a learned Bayesian dynamics model, one can plan multiple steps into the future for exploration, not just single-step posterior updates.

### Open Questions or Possible Critiques

1. **Computational Cost**: Maintaining and repeatedly updating a Bayesian Neural Network posterior can be computationally heavy, especially for high-dimensional tasks or large replay buffers.
2. **Approximation Quality**: The fully factorized Gaussian assumption might underrepresent complex parameter correlations in the dynamics model. Could hamper performance if the environment is intricate or partially random in more nuanced ways.
3. **Long-Horizon Dependencies**: VIME focuses on *one-step* information gain. For partially random tasks requiring multi-step mastery or hierarchical exploration, further expansions might be needed (e.g., multi-step lookahead or hierarchical BNN priors).
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: The agent’s performance can be sensitive to \(\eta\). In practice, robust tuning might be required to balance extrinsic vs. curiosity-driven exploration.
